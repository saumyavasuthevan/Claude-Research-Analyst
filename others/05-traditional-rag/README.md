## 🧪 n8n Traditional RAG Workflow
**Description:** **n8n** workflow to split documents into chunks, convert them into vector embeddings, and store them for semantic retrieval when users query the chatbot.

### 🛠️ How it Works
1.  **Augmentation:** Raw files are segmented and vectorized into a Simple Vector Store.
2.  **Retrieval:** User queries are converted into embeddings to find semantically similar document chunks.
3.  **Generation:** Relevant context is passed to the LLM to provide accurate, grounded answers without processing the entire document at once.

### ✅ Key Capabilities
* **Handle Large Docs:** Effectively analyzes documents of any length.
* **Reduced Hallucinations:** Grounds AI responses in specific, retrieved facts.
* **Semantic Search:** Finds information based on meaning rather than just keywords.
