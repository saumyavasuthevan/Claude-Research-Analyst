# Research Report: Peec AI
**Research Date:** 2026-02-22
**Prepared by:** Research Prompt Generator Agent

> **Note on Data Availability:** Peec AI is a **privately held, early-stage company** founded in early 2025. It is one of the youngest companies in the emerging GEO (Generative Engine Optimization) category. Public data is limited to press releases, investor announcements, and named media coverage. No audited financials are available. The $4M+ ARR figure is self-reported by the company in its Series A announcement. All figures are attributed and any unverifiable data is explicitly labeled.

## 1. Company Overview

| Field | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Legal Name** | Peec AI GmbH |
| **Headquarters** | Berlin, Germany |
| **Founded** | Early 2025 (launched February 2025) |
| **Ownership** | Private, venture-backed |
| **Stage** | Series A (November 2025) |

**Core Business Description:**
Peec AI is an AI search analytics and Generative Engine Optimization (GEO) platform. It enables marketing teams, SEO agencies, and brands to monitor, measure, and improve their visibility in AI-generated search results — specifically within AI-native search engines and chat interfaces including ChatGPT, Perplexity, Google Gemini, Claude, and DeepSeek.

The core problem Peec AI solves: as consumers shift from traditional search engines (Google) to AI-powered discovery tools, brands lose visibility in ways that traditional SEO analytics cannot detect or address. Peec AI provides the equivalent of a "Google Search Console" for the AI era — showing brands where they appear in AI answers, which sources drive those mentions, how they compare to competitors, and what actions improve visibility and sentiment.

**Origin:**
The three co-founders met in **Antler's Berlin Winter 2024 accelerator cohort** and launched the product in February 2025. The company went from zero to $4M+ ARR and 1,300+ customers in under 10 months — entirely within its first year of existence.

**Geographic Footprint:**
- Headquartered in Berlin, Germany
- Customers across Europe, North America, and global markets
- New York office planned for Q2 2026 (announced November 2025)
- Platform supports multi-language and multi-country AI visibility tracking

## 4. Market Position & Competitive Landscape

**Market Context — GEO & AI Search Analytics:**
The GEO (Generative Engine Optimization) market is nascent but growing rapidly, catalyzed by a fundamental shift in how consumers discover information and brands:

- The global GEO services market was valued at approximately **$886M in 2024**, projected to reach **$7.3 billion by 2031** at a CAGR of ~34%. [SOURCE: Valuates Reports via Superlines, 2025]
- Gartner forecasts **25% less traditional search traffic by 2026** and **50% less by 2028** — the structural threat driving demand for GEO tools. [SOURCE: Sequencr.ai GEO Statistics, 2025]
- Perplexity AI recorded **153 million monthly visits in May 2025**, up 192% year-on-year. [SOURCE: Sequencr.ai GEO Statistics, 2025]
- By end-2025, **total funding across GEO/AEO tool providers exceeded $200 million**. [SOURCE: Platelunch Collective AEO Tools Analysis, 2025]
- Only **23% of marketers** are currently investing in prompt tracking and GEO measurement — indicating significant untapped demand. [SOURCE: Omnius GEO Industry Report 2025]

**Peec AI's Positioning:**
- One of the **fastest-growing GEO platforms** by customer acquisition velocity (0 → 1,300+ in 10 months)
- Positioned as the **analytics and measurement layer** for GEO — the "dashboard" for AI search performance
- European-headquartered with **multi-language, multi-country tracking** — a differentiator for non-English-speaking markets
- [ASSUMPTION] Competes on UX simplicity and speed-to-insight vs. more feature-heavy enterprise-oriented competitors

**Competitive Landscape:**

| Competitor | HQ | Funding | Key Differentiator | Positioning vs. Peec AI |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Profound** | USA | $35M Series B (Sequoia) | "Marketing to Superintelligence"; AEO leader; G2 Winter 2026 #1 | More enterprise, deeper AI model integrations; US-first |
| **Brandlight** | USA | Undisclosed | Enterprise governance; no-code workflows; CB Insights Leader | Enterprise-heavy; less self-serve friendly |
| **Otterly AI** | Europe | Undisclosed | Most affordable entry ($29/month); Gartner Cool Vendor 2025 | Strong SMB/agency market; lower price point than Peec |
| **SE Ranking (Visible)** | Europe | Established | Broader SEO suite adding AI tracking; large existing user base | Incumbents adding GEO to existing SEO products |
| **Scrunch AI** | Australia | Undisclosed | Purpose-built GEO metrics; detailed AI-specific analytics | Direct competitor; less European-focused |
| **Gauge** | USA | Undisclosed | AI visibility tracking with action recommendations | Direct analytics competitor |
| **Relixir** | USA | Undisclosed | GEO + content action layer; US-market focused | Moving toward full-stack GEO beyond analytics |

[SOURCES: SearchInfluence AI SEO Tracking Tools 2026; Withgauge.com; ZipTie.dev Peec AI Alternatives; Platelunch Collective AEO Tools 2025; Evertune AI GEO Platforms 2025]

**Peec AI's Competitive Advantages:**
- Speed of execution and growth velocity — rare for a sub-12-month-old company to reach $4M ARR
- Antler and 20VC backing provides network and go-to-market credibility
- Multi-country/multi-language support — stronger out-of-the-box than most US-born competitors
- Customer breadth: mix of enterprise brands (Chanel, TUI, Axel Springer) and high-growth tech (ElevenLabs, n8n, Attio) validates cross-segment appeal
- Clean, opinionated UX reduces onboarding friction vs. feature-bloated alternatives

**Competitive Risks:**
- Profound raised a $35M Series B led by Sequoia — significantly more capital for product and sales
- Large SEO platform incumbents (Semrush, Ahrefs, SE Ranking) are adding AI tracking natively — potential commoditization of basic GEO analytics
- Category is less than 2 years old; market structure and winner-takes-most dynamics are not yet determined

**July 2025 — €7M Seed Round**
Peec AI raised approximately €7M (~$8M) in Seed funding led by 20VC, less than 5 months after launch — a signal of strong early traction and investor conviction in the GEO category. Announced alongside early growth metrics. [SOURCES: EU-Startups July 2025; Silicon Canals July 2025; The AI Insider July 2025]

**November 2025 — $21M Series A**
Peec AI announced a $21M Series A led by Singular, with Antler, Combination VC, identity.vc, and S20 participating. The round was covered by TechCrunch, Sifted, Tech.eu, EU-Startups, and Inc. Magazine — indicating significant category-level media attention. [SOURCES: TechCrunch November 2025; Sifted November 2025; EU-Startups November 2025]

**November 2025 — New York Office Announced**
Concurrent with the Series A, Peec AI announced plans to open a New York office in Q2 2026 — signaling a deliberate US market entry to capture the largest GEO buyer segment. [SOURCE: Peec AI blog, November 2025]

**Ongoing — Platform Expansion Beyond Analytics**
The Series A roadmap explicitly includes expanding from a pure **analytics/measurement platform** into a **full AI-era marketing software stack** — encompassing recommendations, content actions, and workflow automation.

## 6. Key Risks & Challenges

**Category Nascency & Market Education Risk**
GEO as a discipline is less than two years old. Only 23% of marketers currently invest in prompt tracking or GEO measurement. While this represents upside, it also means Peec AI must spend significant resources educating the market — a burden that larger, better-funded competitors or category-defining incumbents can absorb more easily. [SOURCE: Omnius GEO Industry Report 2025]

**AI Search Platform Volatility**
Peec AI's value depends entirely on AI search engines (ChatGPT, Perplexity, Gemini, etc.) maintaining open or semi-open query infrastructure. Any of these platforms limiting third-party analytics access, changing their citation mechanisms, or closing APIs could disrupt Peec AI's data collection capabilities. [ASSUMPTION based on platform dependency analysis]

**Commoditization by SEO Incumbents**
Established SEO platforms (Semrush, Ahrefs, SE Ranking, Moz) have large installed bases and are actively adding AI visibility tracking features. If basic GEO analytics becomes a bundled feature within existing SEO suites, Peec AI's standalone value proposition faces pressure — particularly in the SMB and agency segments. [SOURCE: SearchInfluence AI SEO Tracking Tools 2026]

**Competitive Capital Disadvantage**
Profound's $35M Series B (led by Sequoia) gives it a significant capital advantage over Peec AI's $29M total raised. In a market that may consolidate around 1–2 dominant platforms, capital for product development, enterprise sales, and brand building is a meaningful factor. [SOURCE: Platelunch Collective AEO Tools 2025; ASSUMPTION]

**Regulatory Risk — EU AI Act & GDPR**
As a Berlin-based company processing data about brand mentions, user-generated queries, and competitive intelligence across AI platforms:
- GDPR compliance requirements apply to all personal data processed in the EU
- The EU AI Act's general-purpose AI provisions became effective August 2025 — Peec AI's AI-driven analytics and classification systems may require transparency and documentation obligations
- The most critical AI Act high-risk deadlines apply from August 2026 onward
[SOURCES: EU AI Act Digital Strategy EC; CMS Law-Now EU Data Protection Update, January 2026]

**Execution Risk at Scale**
The company plans to hire 40+ people in 6 months and open a New York office by Q2 2026 — aggressive targets for a sub-2-year-old company. Rapid hiring and geographic expansion simultaneously introduce operational, cultural, and management risks. [ASSUMPTION based on stated expansion plans]

**Runway & Burn Risk**
[DATA UNAVAILABLE — current burn rate and runway not disclosed]. At Series A with $21M raised and aggressive hiring/expansion plans, runway is not publicly quantifiable. [ASSUMPTION] At typical Series A burn rates for a 40-person hiring plan + office launch, this capital likely supports 18–24 months of operation — standard for the stage.

## 7. Analyst & Market Sentiment

**Peec AI is not publicly traded** and is not covered by sell-side equity analysts.

**Press & Media Sentiment:**
Coverage following the Series A was broad and positive:
- **TechCrunch** framed the round in the context of the broader consumer shift away from Google to ChatGPT — lending Peec AI a macro-trend narrative
- **Sifted** (European startup media) and **EU-Startups** provided detailed coverage positioning Peec AI as a European GEO category leader
- **Inc. Magazine** published a profile: *"This Company Raised Millions Helping Businesses Get Noticed by AI"* — mainstream business press validation
- **Tech.eu** covered the raise as part of the broader European AI investment wave

[SOURCES: TechCrunch November 2025; Sifted November 2025; EU-Startups November 2025; Inc. Magazine 2025; Tech.eu November 2025]

**Investor Sentiment:**
The investor roster reflects high conviction from credible backers:
- **20VC** (Harry Stebbings) leading the Seed signals early-mover conviction — 20VC rarely leads rounds without strong qualitative and quantitative signals
- **Singular** leading the Series A is notable — Singular is a selective European VC with a strong portfolio track record
- **Antler's** continued participation from pre-seed through Series A is unusual and signals strong founder conviction

[ASSUMPTION] The speed of the Seed-to-Series A progression (July 2025 → November 2025, approximately 4 months) is exceptionally fast and reflects both the strength of early metrics ($4M ARR, 1,300+ customers) and intense investor interest in GEO as an emerging category.

**User / Customer Sentiment:**
- Customer testimonials cited in press coverage emphasise platform clarity and actionability
- One publicly cited user review: *"Peec avoids the issues we see with other SEO/AEO platforms where there can be an overload of features"*
- [DATA UNAVAILABLE — no independent review platform aggregate scores (G2, Capterra) found in public sources at time of research, likely due to company's very early age]

**Market / Category Validation:**
- Profound (competitor) received a $35M Series B from **Sequoia Capital** — top-tier validation of the GEO category as an investable market
- **Otterly AI** named **Gartner Cool Vendor 2025** for AI in Marketing — further category analyst recognition
- Total GEO/AEO category funding exceeded $200M by end of 2025 [SOURCE: Platelunch Collective, 2025]
