# 🕵️‍♂️ Claude Code Research Analyst

A specialized configuration for Claude Code designed to perform structured company and market research. 

## 🛠 Project Rationale
This framework was developed to address common limitations found in standard LLM research tasks. By utilizing a two-phase "Architect-Execute" workflow, the system focuses on three core technical objectives:

1. **Hallucination Mitigation:** The system is hard-coded to label missing figures as `[DATA UNAVAILABLE]` rather than generating estimates.
2. **Explicit User Alignment:** A mandatory "Confirmation Gate" ensures the agent's research plan is reviewed and approved before execution begins.
3. **Verified Data Provenance:** Every report requires a "Sources & Data Provenance" section to ensure all quantitative claims are grounded in credible, named sources.A two-phase company research agent powered by Claude Code for market intelligence.

## 💡 The "Architect-Execute" Workflow
This agent operates as a **Research Architect**. Output is never returned in the same turn as the initial request:

1.  **Phase 1: Prompt Generation:** Upon request (e.g., *"Research Stripe"*), the agent builds a **Structured Research Prompt** covering 8 key business dimensions.
2.  **Phase 2: Confirmation Gate:** The agent pauses. You must review the plan and reply `confirmed` (or request specific adjustments).
3.  **Phase 3: Execution:** Only after approval does the agent execute the research and synthesize the final report.

## 📊 Standardized Report Structure
Every report generated by this analyst follows a consistent 8-section schema to ensure side-by-side comparability:
